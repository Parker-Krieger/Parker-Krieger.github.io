            Most of my web development experience comes from work experience rather than class experience. I've been
            working as a web developer for a little over a year. I have worked with Angular and .NET at my job, but
            I also have a small amount of experience with Vue, React, Node.js, and Django from other projects. While
            I do full-stack development for work I have a slight preference towards back-end work and would be
            happy if I never touched UX again in my life!
